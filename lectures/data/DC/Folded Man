<td>The Changeling</td>
<td><i>Flash Comics</i> #84</td>
<td>Nothing is known of the life of Erik Razar before he became a small-time gangster in Keystone City. In the early 1940s, Razar ran a small mob that was taken over by gangster Topper Hull. Hull framed Razar and had sent him to prison. In the summer of 1947, Razar hatched a plan to escape by sabotaging the prison power generator. His plan had an unforeseen side effect, charging Razar with enormous amounts of electricity and giving him the ability to change into different animals. Razar used his new powers to escape and set out in pursuit of Hull. Disguised as a bird, Razar learns that Hull has planned a bank job by intercepting an armored car delivery. Razar decided to torture Hull by thwarting his crimes and intercepted the car first. By this point, the police had consulted with scientist Jay Garrick who was among those who witnessed Razar, as a large bull elephant, intercept and dismantle the armored car. Quickly changing to the Flash, Garrick engaged the shape-shifting criminal, but was quickly dispatched into a large water reservoir.
<p>Razar, now named the Changeling by the local papers, decided to foil Hull's hijack of a sunken ship recovery operation and then kill him. The Flash also became aware of Hull's plans by eavesdropping in his invisible super-speeding form and determined to intercept them both. Razar dove into the water as Hull's boat left the pier and transformed himself into a large shark. The Flash dived in behind the Changeling, but the criminal irritated a large clam which seized the Flash's leg and threatened to drown him. After extricating himself, he came upon the Changeling-shark threatening the divers in the recovery operation and assaulted him. Deciding that he would need to kill the villain to stop him, the Flash battered the shark's gills until it could not breathe and then knocked it unconscious as the Changeling tried to change forms. As the unconscious and unmoving shark drifted to the bottom, the Flash left to capture Hull. (<i>Flash Comics</i> #84) Whether or not the Changeling survived has never been determined.

<td>Mazdan</td>
<td><i>Showcase</i> #4 (October 1956)</td>
<td>A criminal from the 38th century, who the authorities decide to exile to the 50th century when Earth is desolate. He is accidentally sent to the 20th century and tries to steal equipment needed to repair his time capsule, such as gold to coat it, and get back to the future to exact revenge, using advanced heat-based weapons. The Flash discovers this and captures Mazdan, who escapes using a contact lens that fires lasers and a "magnetic rod" that focuses heat; the Flash discovers that if Mazdan escapes using his time capsule, it will destroy everything within a radius of at least 10 miles, killing thousands. He uses his super-speed to break through the time barrier with Mazdan, who, oddly enough, does not die from the friction and returns to the 38th century. The authorities say they will make sure next time the time capsule reaches the 50th century and the Flash returns to his own time. Mazdan later escapes to the 20th century again and uses a mind-affecting hallucinatory weapon to cause trouble for the Flash, but is beaten again and returned to prison in the 38th century.

Seeing an article about a weapon that might disrupt the Flash's speed, Snart made a gun and exposed it to radiations. However, due to the fact Snart was not experienced in the use of the device and activated it incorrectly, instead of slowing the Flash down, the gun could freeze anything to <a href="/wiki/Absolute_zero" title="Absolute zero">absolute zero</a>, which he discovered when he accidentally used it on a watchman.

Under the leadership of Mynher, they sent a hive to the distant past, 100,842,246 B.C., which robbed Earth's minerals of all its radioactivity. This, in turn, caused the atomic weapons of humanity to deactivate.

He is knocked out by a radiation gun and taken captive, and Kid Flash is stung by a giant insect in the past. Finally, he is given an antidote by half-man/half-bird beings.

Initially, the duplicates worked with Manuel in his 'one-man' crusade against Basilisk, but when they began to die for no reason in the same order in which they were 'born', their new mission became to find a doctor who can find a cure so they could continue to live. Members of Mob Rule all identify each other by numbers based on the order in which they were 'born'. After encountering Mob Rule trying to steal a human genome re-coder, Barry Allen identifies his old friend Manuel Lago as one of the thieves. Later the next night, Manuel breaks into Barry's apartment being chased by Mob Rule, so Barry follows his friend. When Barry catches up with Manuel he finds his old friend surrounded by copies of himself. The duplicates have kidnapped Iris West and will only let her go if the Flash allows them to take Manuel, to which the Flash reluctantly agrees. Mob Rule had kidnapped Dr. Guerrero, the original doctor who gave Manuel his regenerative powers, and were forcing him to find out why they were dying. Even with Manuel as their hostage, the doctor could not find out why their lifetime was limited to just a few months. They killed Dr. Guerrero and replenished their ranks by cutting off Manuel's fingers and hands again. With Dr. Guerrero dead, they seek out the man who built the genome re-coder, Dr. Darwin Elias, and kidnap him. With the help of his friend and co-worker Patty Spivot, Barry finds Manuel being held by Mob Rule in Dr. Guerrero's lab. Mob Rule finds them and Barry stays behind to give Patty and Manuel a chance to escape.
