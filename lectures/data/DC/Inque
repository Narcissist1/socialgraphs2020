<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Batman_(Terry_McGinnis)" title="Batman (Terry McGinnis)">Terry McGinnis</a></b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Will_Friedle" title="Will Friedle">Will Friedle</a>) - The current Batman and a former juvenile delinquent. Under the pretense of doing errands for Bruce, Terry fights crime as the new Batman. Terry was chosen to be the new Dark Knight as he shared a similar loss as Bruce had; that being the death of a parent.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Bruce Wayne</a></b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Conroy" title="Kevin Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a>) - The original Batman, he is Terry's employer, mentor, and predecessor. During his final mission as Batman, Bruce suffered a <a href="/wiki/Heart_attack" class="mw-redirect" title="Heart attack">heart attack</a> that forced him to use a gun in self-defense; abhorred by this, he hung up his cape and cowl.</li>
<li><b>Maxine "Max" Gibson</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Cree_Summer" title="Cree Summer">Cree Summer</a>) - A genius high schooler and friend of Terry's. She discovers his secret identity early on in the series, and from then on occasionally helps Batman in an <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">"Alfred"</a>-type role, though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor (but less so as time went on). Her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister.</li>

Fiercely loyal to Bruce, he eventually develops a bond with Terry.</li></ul>

Warren was murdered by Mr. Fixx at the start of the series. Terry moves in with his mother after his father's death. Mary believes that Terry works as an errand boy for Bruce.

<li><b>Matt McGinnis</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Ryan_O%27Donohue" title="Ryan O&#39;Donohue">Ryan O'Donohue</a>) - Terry's younger brother. Always looking to get his brother in trouble, Matt is ironically a big fan of Batman. In the rebooted universe, Matt finds out about Terry's secret and becomes an invaluable ally to Batman.

No longer the beautiful, dashing young heroine she once was, having been hardened and determined through the years of personal tragedy to her friends, the new Commissioner Gordon is not entertained by the notion of Batman's heir and often clashes with Terry, though time helps her to realize his value to Neo-Gotham. Unlike most <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a> universes, she has never lost the use of her legs or become the Oracle, although the event that in the comics led her to become the latter was referenced in the episode "A Touch of Curaré".

He seems to be popular with the girls, but never has a steady girlfriend. He is very similar, both physically and mentally, to <a href="/wiki/Flash_Thompson" title="Flash Thompson">Flash Thompson</a> from the <i><a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a></i> universe, given his adversarial-turned-friendly relationship with Terry and his admiration for Batman.</li></ul>

There have been three different versions of the Jokerz. The first group of Jokerz seen was introduced in the series premiere "Rebirth", committing petty pranks and harassment before being framed for the murder of Terry's father. They have appeared throughout the series since. The second group of Jokerz was introduced in the episode "Hidden Agenda", shown committing more violent and arsonist acts than the first group. They have appeared throughout the series since, with the exception of Terminal. The third group of Jokerz was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_Beyond:_Return_of_the_Joker" title="Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</a></i> where they worked for what appeared to be the original Joker. They later appeared in an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i>, now working for <a href="/wiki/Chronos_(comics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Chronos (comics)">Chronos</a> and enhanced with super powers.

<li><b>Scab</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Marc_Worden" title="Marc Worden">Marc Worden</a>) - A member of the Jokerz that wears a red single-coned jester's cap. Scab was possibly inspired by Harley Quinn. He wears a giant boxing glove on his right hand.</li>
<li><b>Top Hat</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Timm" title="Bruce Timm">Bruce Timm</a>) - A member of the Jokerz that wears an outfit that is similar to the DCAU version of the <a href="/wiki/Penguin_(character)" title="Penguin (character)">Penguin</a>.</li>
<li><b>Lee</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Embry" title="Ethan Embry">Ethan Embry</a>) - A student at Hamilton Hill High School. He dropped out to join the Jokerz. When Scab and Coe stole an experimental aircraft during his initiation, he began to doubt his dreams to be a member of the Jokerz. When the reactor became unstable, he knocked out Scab and shut the reactor. Lee then left the Jokerz afterwards.</li>
<li><b>Carter Wilson / Terminal</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Rosenbaum" title="Michael Rosenbaum">Michael Rosenbaum</a>) - Carter Wilson is a popular and genius student at Hamilton Hill High School who was obsessed with being the best at everything he did. He led the second group of Jokerz in an attempt to kill Maxine Gibson, who had scored higher on an important test than he had, and was going to be voted Class Valedictorian instead of him. Terminal's vendetta against Max and the subsequent intervention by Batman led to Max's realization of Terry's secret identity. Terminal later appears in the rebooted universe trying to revive a dying Bruce Wayne in order to gain access to his Keytone data network. He disguises Bruce as the Joker in order to gain influence and control over the Jokerz. He is later killed by the real Joker, who had been aiding him in his scheme.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Trey</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Omar_Gooding" title="Omar Gooding">Omar Gooding</a>) - Terminal's "right-hand clown." He dropped out of school in the 6th grade to join the Jokerz. He used to be a member of J-Man's gang, but eventually joined up with Terminal's gang afterwards.</li>

He used to be a member of J-Man's branch of the Jokerz, but joined Terminal's branch later on.</li>
<li><b>Bonk</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Henry_Rollins" title="Henry Rollins">Henry Rollins</a> in <i>Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</i>, <a href="/wiki/Adam_Baldwin" title="Adam Baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a> in <i>Justice League Unlimited</i>) - A powerful, but surly enforcer/<a href="/wiki/Strongman_(strength_athlete)" title="Strongman (strength athlete)">muscleman</a> in the Jokerz' ranks. Though amazingly strong, Bonk is not a thug who takes orders willingly (especially if it has to do with swiping what he calls "a lot of geek junk" instead of cash). He has a hair-trigger and is liable to start up with anyone who gets in his way, be it Batman or Bonk's own Jokerz allies. This is his undoing when he argues with the Joker, accusing him of being a fake. In return, the Joker murders him either with a venomous spear gun disguised as a BANG! flag gun, or with laughing gas (depending on the unedited or edited version of the film). He appears during the <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited" title="Justice League Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></i> multi-part episode "The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2" equipped with a massive hammer that comes out of his arm. He is able to deliver massive damage with this weapon.</li>
<li><b>Chucko</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Don_Patrick_Harvey" class="mw-redirect" title="Don Patrick Harvey">Don Harvey</a>) - <a href="/wiki/Obese" class="mw-redirect" title="Obese">Obese</a> with tight-fitting pink clothes and a clown mask, he is a nasty bullying type who truly enjoys inflicting misery on others. A head enforcer for the Jokerz, he is a lot stronger and faster than his flabby gut would lead one to believe. True to his sadistic nature, Chucko's face is always hidden behind his mocking clown mask (aside from the heist at Wayne Enterprises, where he was wearing a gas mask). He uses a <a href="/wiki/Bazooka" title="Bazooka">bazooka</a> as a weapon. An alternate-time stream version of Chucko appears in the <i>Justice League Unlimited</i> episode "The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2". He appears here with a hovering ball instead of his normal legs and carries a <a href="/wiki/Lightsaber" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber-like object</a>. The ball offers more maneuverability than he previously had with his legs and the saber adds extra "oomph." He betrays Chronos by tipping off the Justice League Unlimited and is sent back to the prehistoric age at the moment when the meteor that killed the dinosaurs arrived. This incident serves as a warning to the other members of the Jokerz.</li>
<li><b>Dee Dee</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart" title="Melissa Joan Hart">Melissa Joan Hart</a>) - The identical twin granddaughters of <a href="/wiki/Harley_Quinn" title="Harley Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> and an unnamed individual. Delia and Deidre Dennis (often referred to by the collective name "Dee Dee" or simply, "the Deeds") are cute, charming, funny, and completely rotten to the core. They love the thrill of being part of the Jokerz and think it is a large charge to be working for the big man himself, the Joker. They use an acrobatics-based fighting style very similar to Harley's. They fight in unison, acting almost like one person controlling two bodies, even finishing each other's sentences. They are imprisoned at the end of <i>Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</i>, but bailed out by their grandmother, the former Harley Quinn, whom they refer to as "Nana Harley." They appear in the <i>Justice League Unlimited</i> episode "The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2" with the power to multiply themselves upon impact. They also carry an energy whip, which electrocutes the victim on contact. This whip is what led to Terry and Kai-Ro's alternate deaths until this timeline was erased. It had been assumed that they were the Joker's biological granddaughters; however, events that take place in <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_and_Harley_Quinn" title="Batman and Harley Quinn">Batman and Harley Quinn</a></i> strongly suggest that they are in fact the biological granddaughters of <a href="/wiki/Dick_Grayson" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harley_Quinn" title="Harley Quinn">Harley Quinn</a>.</li>
<li><b>Ghoul</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Rosenbaum" title="Michael Rosenbaum">Michael Rosenbaum</a> impersonating <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Walken" title="Christopher Walken">Christopher Walken</a>) - He wears ragged clothing and has grey skin, numerous stitching/scar marks and skull-like features; possibly he genetically altered his appearance to make himself look undead. His appearance vaguely mimics that of previous Batman nemesis the <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(DC_Comics)" title="Scarecrow (DC Comics)">Scarecrow</a>. A jaded young runaway from a wealthy home, Ghoul joined up with the Jokerz for kicks. He is heavily into techno-goth music and has adapted the horror look into his costume. Ghoul is never without his plastic Halloween pumpkin, which he keeps filled with a number of monster-inspired weapons and tricks. Ghoul eventually returned in the <i>Justice League Unlimited</i> episode "The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2". He is now armed with a spinning blade in his right arm, which he can deploy or retract at will. It is also revealed in this episode that he <a href="/wiki/Bedwetting" class="mw-redirect" title="Bedwetting">wet the bed</a> until he was 14.</li>

Infusing his cellular structure with that of a <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyena</a>, Woof quickly transformed (some say devolved) into the giggling, bestial nightmare that he is today. Though he sometimes appears to be nothing more than the Jokerz' comical mascot, Woof's crushing jaws, sharp teeth, and razor-like claws make him a deadly adversary. He appears in the <i>Justice League Unlimited</i> episode "The Once and Future Thing Pt. 2". In this appearance, he is equipped with cybernetic arms, which allow him to run faster than he previously could. The arms are also able to gouge materials as hard as concrete and steel, as they are sharper and sturdier than his claws once were.</li></ul></li>

Seeking revenge, he stole a mentally-controlled robot called the GoLeM (Galvanized Lifting Machine) from his father's construction company and used it to attack his tormentors, but the machine was destroyed by Batman and he was sent to juvenile detention for three years. However, his experience with the GoLeM caused him to develop powerful <a href="/wiki/Psychokinetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Psychokinetic">psychokinetic</a> abilities, which he uses to bring terror to his fellow detainees and secretly leave and return to the facility at will. He attempted revenge on his schoolmates again by using his powers to convince everyone the school was haunted. Despite having been defeated by Batman once more, Willie's powers remain active. He is also somewhat friendly to Terry McGinnis since he was not one of his tormentors; not knowing that Terry and his enemy, Batman, are the same person.</li>
<li><span id="Mr._Freeze"></span><b><a href="/wiki/Mr._Freeze" title="Mr. Freeze">Mister Freeze</a></b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Ansara" title="Michael Ansara">Michael Ansara</a>) - The tragic villain lives on as nothing but an immortal head preserved by Derek Powers; used as a test subject in an attempt to clone a new body for Powers. However, Freeze's new body begins to suffer the same symptoms as his previous body. After Powers' scientist tries to eliminate Freeze to study the problem, he seeks revenge, leading to a final battle with Derek Powers' alter ego, Blight, and Batman as well.

He is led down a decidedly darker path by Derek Powers, who wants a return on his investment in Shreeve's research. He thus dubs him "Shriek", based on his special suit which allows him to generate destructive sound waves and manipulate <a href="/wiki/Sound" title="Sound">sound</a> in a wide variety of ways. During a fight with Batman, his suit is damaged, causing it to pick up sounds at such a high volume that Shreeve is rendered permanently <a href="/wiki/Deafness" title="Deafness">deaf</a>.

Three years prior to Terry becoming Batman, Charlie was arrested for burglary and sentenced to three years in prison. It is revealed that Terry was also arrested during the burglary, but avoided prison because he was underage at the time, and that Terry's early life of petty crime was largely the result of Charlie's negative influence. Charlie attempts to reconnect with Terry after he is released, but is rebuffed due to his continuing criminal behavior. Charlie later becomes involved with a gang of thieves-for-hire who plan to rob a Wayne-Powers research lab to steal an experimental chemical for a rival company. During the robbery, Terry (as Batman) intervenes. Charlie is exposed to the chemical during the fight, and later mutates into a deformed super-strong giant; an event which leaves Terry wracked with guilt.

In the rebooted universe, the Spellbinder brainwashes Terry into believing he is Davis Dusk and the new Rewire.</li>
<li><b>The <a href="/wiki/Man-Bat" title="Man-Bat">Man-Bat</a></b> - After the original Batman helped rescue his wife Francine from her own Man-Bat metamorphosis (see the <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i> episode "Terror in the Sky"), Kirk Langstrom had vowed to never again take the serum that had nearly destroyed his life.  After he swore off genetic research, and with funding from Wayne Enterprises, both he and Francine became pioneers in the field of sonics and acoustics. Kirk somehow also discovered that Bruce Wayne was Batman years ago when he funded Kirk's sonic research. Though both Kirk and Francine were happily married for years and eventually had a son and a daughter named Max and Michelle, Francine eventually begins to suffer from <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease" title="Parkinson&#39;s disease">Parkinson's disease</a> and Kirk's relationship with his children begins to deteriorate. After Francine’s death and his children’s subsequent discovery of his secret (which cause them to walk out on him), Kirk's sanity collapses; using an improved version of the Man-Bat serum, he assumes that identity again, this time with full control over the Man-Bat.</li>

It is responsible for transforming most of Earth into a cybernetic apocalypse and the death of Terry McGinnis, leading Tim Drake to become the new Batman Beyond. When Tim discovers that time travel cannot defeat Brother Eye, he destroys it by attacking it on its moon base with the help of Inque.</li>
<li><b>The <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(DC_Comics)" title="Scarecrow (DC Comics)">Scarecrow</a></b> - <b>Adayln Stern</b> was the daughter of a notorious gang leader in Gotham. As a child, she is traumatized after witnessing the original Batman ruthlessly beat up her father in front of her. Her fear of Batman was amplified when she was placed in institutional care by one of Jonathan Crane's disciples. She grew up to become a co-anchor to Jack Ryder on News 52. She succeeds Crane as the new Scarecrow and attempts to use A. I. cubes that are present in everyone's homes to turn Neo-Gotham against Batman, but fails and is put in Arkham Asylum when she sees herself as no one but the Scarecrow.</li></ul>

Reid inadvertently created a successor who would carry on his legacy by cloning one of the original Batman's partners. It is believed that her grandfather died as Hush after his last battle with the original Dark Knight Detective. However, despite the official police report confirming the body's identity, Elliot's reputation as a master tactician and skilled surgeon had left his enemies in doubt of whether it really belonged to the villain.  Because of the Elliot family's history of depravity and deception, many also doubt whether Doctor Reid is really as decent as she seems to be.</li>

Chill is also a former security guard of Wayne-Powers who worked under Derek Powers' right-hand-man Mr. Fixx. His employment by Powers had led Chill down the same path as his great-granduncle's: by killing Warren McGinnis under Mr. Fixx's orders, leaving him wracked with guilt towards the McGinnises and repeating history again by indirectly creating a Batman. After Bruce Wayne reclaimed his family's company, he fired Chill after he had been discovered to have worked at Powers' "Quiet Squad", aware of Chill's relation to his parents' killer and his possible involvement in Warren McGinnis' murder. His termination also drove Chill towards poverty. Seeing Batman as an inspiration, Chill sets to become a vigilante himself to atone for his family's sins.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> He called himself Vigilante and worked with Batman to stop a Jokerz riot led by Doug Tan.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> He is eventually killed by the Jokerz and the Phantasm (who was sent to kill him by Waller to prevent Batman from doing so after Terry discovered his identity).

<p>In the parallel universe where the <a href="/wiki/Justice_Lords" title="Justice Lords">Justice Lords</a> reside, the original Lord Batman has long died after fighting Lord Superman, Lady Wonder Woman, and their tyrannical followers. In the future of that world, Bruce Wayne's absence affected those who were closest to him and, in addition, those who would have been if he was still alive:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Terrance "T" McGinnis (Justice Lords)</b> - Terrence "T" McGinnis is in a relationship with the former Royal Flush Gang member Ten (Melanie Walker), and without Bruce Wayne’s guidance, he remains a delinquent and is a member of the Jokerz alongside his lover. After T. meets his heroic counterpart, he begins to question his purpose in life.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> After the Justice Lords' defeat, T. is inspired to become the new Batman, with Dick Grayson as his mentor.  Unlike his counterpart, T. is not driven by the tragic death of his father (whose murder never occurred in this world), but by Lord Superman's unjust actions upon the world.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Mary McGinnis (Justice Lords)</b> - Suffering former wife of Warren McGinnis and mother of T. McGinnis.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Dick Grayson (Justice Lords)</b> - Like his counterpart, Grayson also served as Lord Batman's partner as Robin and later Nightwing. However, due to the Joker being lobotomized by Lord Superman years before, Grayson never sustained an injury resulting in the loss of an eye, as did his counterpart. In turn, his successor Tim Drake never gave up being Robin and went on to become the <a href="/wiki/Red_Robin_(comics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Red Robin (comics)">Red Robin</a> until Lord Batman's death forced both Grayson and Drake to retire from superheroics. In addition, Grayson married Barbara Gordon and worked as a high-ranking officer to the Justice Lords' task force. However, Dick did not allow Gotham to completely descend into a totalitarian state like the rest of the world.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Terry McGinnis' arrival inspired Grayson to continue his late mentor's mission and to groom McGinnis' counterpart into the new Batman.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Barbara Gordon (Justice Lords)</b> - Wife of Dick Grayson.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>  Like her husband, Barbara also previously served as Lord Batman's partner as Batgirl, but unlike her counterpart, Barbara was never romantically involved with Bruce Wayne (who was happily married to Wonder Woman prior to his death), and thus never indirectly caused the disintegration between Dick's bond with his mentor. She and Dick are happily married and they have a son.</li>
<li><b>John Grayson II</b> - Young son of Dick Grayson and Barbara Gordon.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Learning of John's existence makes the mainstream universe's Dick Grayson envy the life his counterpart leads with his wife and he becomes more bitter towards Bruce, who indirectly caused the disintegration of his relationship with Barbara.</li>
<li><b>Warren McGinnis (Justice Lords)</b> - Suffering former husband of Mary McGinnis and father of T. McGinnis.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Zod</b> - Genetically engineered son of Lord Superman and Lady Wonder Woman who joins the Justice League as the youngest member and under the tutelage of his father's benevolent counterpart, Superman.</li></ul>
