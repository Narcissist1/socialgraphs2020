<p><b><a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Virgil Ovid Hawkins/Static</a></b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Phil_LaMarr" title="Phil LaMarr">Phil LaMarr</a>) is an African-American 9th grade high school student in Dakota City. As a result of accidental exposure to an experimental <a href="/wiki/Mutagen" title="Mutagen">mutagen</a> in an event known as the Big Bang, he gained the ability to control and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/manipulate" class="extiw" title="wikt:manipulate">manipulate</a> <a href="/wiki/Electromagnetism" title="Electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a>, and uses these powers to become a superhero named "Static." Countless others who were also exposed gained a wide variety of mutations and abilities, and Static spends much of his time dealing with these "Bang Babies", many of whom use their abilities in selfish, harmful, and even criminal ways. Virgil is an intelligent young man with a strong sense of justice, but grapples with a lot of self-doubt.

Robert is a strict but caring parent. He strongly dislikes gangs and the destructive attitudes of most Bang Babies, and his work at the community center is motivated by a desire to counteract their bad influence on young people.
</p><p>In the episode "Static Shaq", it is mentioned that Robert has also been in the <a href="/wiki/Marine_(military)" class="mw-redirect" title="Marine (military)">Marines</a> and a camp counselor. In the episode "Blast from the Past", Robert states that when he was a kid, he was (and still is) a fan of the superhero Soul Power. In the episode "Linked", it is revealed that Robert played <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">football</a> in college, and he was nicknamed "Streak." At first, Robert disliked Static; his open opinion about Static in the episode "Aftershock" left Virgil worried that the <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang_(comics)" title="Big Bang (comics)">Big Bang</a> might have aftereffects. Robert remained unaware of his son's secret identity through most of the series, although part of him had suspicions about Virgil's behavior.
</p><p>In the episode "Kidnapped", Robert acknowledged the truth that had been right under his nose: his son, Virgil, was Static. He figured this out as the reason why Omnara would have Puff and Onyx kidnap him in order to draw out Static. In the end following Omnara's defeat, Robert keeps his son's superhero identity along with Gear's secret, even from his daughter.

<p><b>Sharon Hawkins</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Michele_Morgan_(American_actress)" title="Michele Morgan (American actress)">Michele Morgan</a>) is Virgil's strong-willed, and caring older sister. Sharon attends college, but she still lives at home. She also volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center, like her father. Sharon has always been a big fan of Static. Although deep down, she and her younger brother do love each other in a brother-sister way, they frequently argue, challenge, and tease each other, mainly about things such as the household chores, his studying, and her cooking (which is usually barely edible).
</p><p>Sharon has been dating Adam Evans a.k.a. The Rubber-Band Man since the episode "Bent Out of Shape"; though she knows about his super identity, she genuinely cares for him. In the episode "Brother-Sister Act," Sharon notices how similar Static and Virgil are, and tries to pin him down with proof of her suspicions, but is later tricked into thinking that her suspicions were wrong. In the episode "Out of Africa", she was the recipient of a golden spider amulet, which temporarily granted her the power/ability to create illusions; however when she returned the amulet to Anansi, the abilities vanished. At the end of the fourth season, Sharon continues to be in the dark about her brother's superhero secret, though in the final episode "Power Outage", she becomes suspicious once again of Virgil's behavior until their father interrupts them.

<p><b>Jean Hawkins</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Alfre_Woodard" title="Alfre Woodard">Alfre Woodard</a>) is Robert's wife, and the mother of Sharon and Virgil.  Jean is frequently mentioned throughout the series. In "Shock to the System", (the first episode of season 1), it was mentioned that she had died from gangfire; in "Flashback", in season 3, Jean Hawkins was shown to have been a <a href="/wiki/Paramedic" title="Paramedic">paramedic</a>, and that specifically she had been fatally wounded by a stray bullet during the Dakota Riots, which happened exactly five years prior to the events of the episodes of "Flashback". Her death is at the root of Virgil's intense dislike of <a href="/wiki/Gun" title="Gun">guns</a>, effectively preventing Virgil from getting involved too deeply in gangs. She was very important to all of her family, especially to Virgil, who was only 10 years old when she died. In "Tantrum", (season 1), Hawkins family movies show that she really knew what made Virgil tick even when he was a baby; it is also shown that Virgil visits his mother's grave and talks to her when he's troubled.
</p><p>Jean makes her only physical appearance in the events of "Flashback", when Static, Gear, Time-Zone and Ebon were all transported back in time by Time-Zone's powers to the night of the Dakota Riots.  Although Static attempted to convince her to stay in a safe place, (even revealing that he was her son Virgil from the future), she still left to go on duty as a paramedic and was killed that night by a stray bullet by gangfire, but not before telling Virgil how proud she was of him having become a superhero—a statement which finally gave Virgil closure over her untimely death.

<p><b>Richard "Richie" Osgood Foley</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Jason_Marsden" title="Jason Marsden">Jason Marsden</a>) is an ally of lead character Static, and Virgil Hawkins' best friend. The two go far back. He was not present for the Big Bang, but Static's clothes still carried some of the gas, and his powers were dormant until Season Three. His power is superhuman intelligence, having invented a number of weapons and devices for Static and himself to use. His superhuman intelligence allows for a very limited form of <a href="/wiki/Technopathy" class="mw-redirect" title="Technopathy">technopathy</a> with his visor and Back-Pack, as seen in episode 52 when Richie was no longer able to interpret the data stream in his visor and his backpack was no longer able to sync with his brain, which was at genius level when Back-Pack was programmed.
</p><p>According to series creators, Richie's character was based on <a href="/wiki/Rick_Stone_(DC_Comics)" class="mw-redirect" title="Rick Stone (DC Comics)">Rick Stone</a>, Virgil's best friend in the comics, who is gay. However, since his sexual orientation could not be explored within the context of a children's television series at the time of the show's original run, it was never addressed if the TV series-character was gay as well, though McDuffie did consider him gay and make subtle nods to the fact that he is in some episodes.

<p><b>Adam Evans/Rubber-Band Man</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Kadeem_Hardison" title="Kadeem Hardison">Kadeem Hardison</a>) is a meta-human transmorph, whose body structure consists of living rubber, which he can shape into a wide variety of forms, even to the point of altering his physical appearance into that of another person. Adam's <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">superhero handle</a> is a probable nod to the song, "<a href="/wiki/The_Rubberband_Man" title="The Rubberband Man">The Rubberband Man</a>", by <a href="/wiki/The_Spinners_(American_R%26B_group)" title="The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)">The Spinners</a>.
</p><p>Much like Static, he changes his superhero look between seasons; in the first season, he has a full-body purple suit that covers his head, while in the second season he switches to a black suit (while leaving his head exposed). Since Rubber-Band Man and his brother Ebon can both stretch themselves, it is possible that the effects of the gas may have something to do with the person's genetic code. The name "<i>Adam Evans</i>" is derived from the names of former <a href="/wiki/Milestone_Comics" class="mw-redirect" title="Milestone Comics">Milestone</a> writers <a href="/wiki/Maddie_Blaustein" title="Maddie Blaustein">Adam Blaustein</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yves_Fezzani&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yves Fezzani (page does not exist)">Yves Fezzani</a>, who created the character. The alias "Stringer" Rubber-Band Man uses in one episode is his real last name of his comic version, first used in <i><a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a></i> #34.
</p><p>Adam is also a talented musician who is on the verge of a professional career. His greatest personal weakness is a <a href="/wiki/Dyslexia" title="Dyslexia">reading disorder</a>, which he has to struggle through. He is the younger brother of Static's archenemy, <a href="#Ebon">Ebon</a>. Prior to the <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang_(comics)" title="Big Bang (comics)">Big Bang</a>, Adam was part of his brother's gang before he took a stock-clerk job at a music store called Stonegas Records.  Rubber-Band Man first appears as a <a href="/wiki/Tragic_villain" class="mw-redirect" title="Tragic villain">tragic villain</a> when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who had stolen one of his songs. He would subsequently break out of prison but deciding not to pursue a criminal career, uses his powers to take up a new identity, "Stringer", and becomes a musical rising star. He also started dating Virgil's sister Sharon, and although he initially clashes with Static, he does not carry on his grudge against him after meeting Sharon, even reforming and becomes one of his allies in crime-fighting. While on patrol, Rubber-Band Man typically acts as an older brother figure to Static, keeping him from showing off and reminding him of consequences in their work — something that Adam's real brother Ebon never actually did when he looked after Adam prior to the Big Bang. It is unknown if Adam Evans was exposed to the cure for the Big Bang that neutralized many of the Bang Babies in Dakota at the end of the series.

While looking for Static and Gear, she bumped into Ebon. He wanted to use her powers to avoid the cops. After being saved from Ebon, Gear ran tests on her and found out that she had no control over her powers. Since she wanted to become a hero, Gear made a remote that was linked to a belt around her costume. The remote helped her control her powers. Now named as the superhero Time-Zone, Nina became the third member of the Shock Pack, but her time as a member was brief: Due to an encounter with Ebon, Nina decided that her powers were too dangerous to keep, and went back in time to stop her past self from being present at the night of the <a href="/wiki/Big_Bang_(comics)" title="Big Bang (comics)">Big Bang</a> (by stealing her own bike, according to Richie.)

Shiv's abilities enable him to generate pure whitish-pink "light energy", which he could blast at opponents, and fashion into numerous useful tools and weapons which he could hold, throw, or fashion around his arms and hands, giving rise to his new alias; 'Shiv.'

As a metahuman, Talon had clawlike digits on her hands and talon-like digits on her feet; she was covered in white orange feathers, but retained her red hair color. The most notable attribute of her transformation was a set of feathered patagia extending from her scapula to her forearms, which enabled her to fly by flapping her arms. As an offensive aspect bestowed upon her by her exposure to the Big Bang, Talon could emit incredibly strong, large, visible lavender-colored hypersonic shrieks from her mouth and vocal cords (similar to the Marvel Comics superhero <a href="/wiki/Banshee_(comics)" title="Banshee (comics)">Banshee</a> and DC's <a href="/wiki/Black_Canary" title="Black Canary">Black Canary</a>), although her hypersonic sound abilities are completely useless if her mouth is gagged.
</p><p>Talon was first introduced as a member of the Meta-Breed, making her a frequent opponent of Static. When the cure was introduced, Talon accompanied Ebon, Hot-Streak, and Shiv to steal the last canister of gas. However, before they could escape, Talon was restored to normal, and she was more than glad to stay that way. Ebon, whose powers were deteriorating, was forced to leave her behind; at the hospital, she abandoned the name of Talon for her real name, and told Static and Gear that Ebon was going to use the gas to set off another Big Bang. That night, Teresa got kidnapped by Ebon, who refused to let her leave his side, and was taken to the docks to be re-exposed. She was saved by Static and Gear, who were captured shortly afterwards. In return, she freed them and escaped the area, just before Ebon and Hot-Streak began wreaking havoc as a fused super-enhanced, flame-and-shadow monster.

After being exposed to the gas, Francis Stone became Hotstreak.

His powers are loosely based on the <a href="/wiki/Human_Torch" title="Human Torch">Human Torch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pyro_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Pyro (Marvel Comics)">Pyro</a>. In the TV show, his bullying seems mainly driven by his crush on Frieda.
</p><p>Hotstreak was one of Static's very first rivals — giving him a challenge nearly every time they meet. The fights seem to be personal in some way, since Static and Hotstreak already had history with each other as Virgil and Francis prior to the Big Bang. Before the Big Bang, Francis was a feared school bully and gang leader who went under the nickname of "F-Stop" and often went after Virgil for his wisecracks at his expense. He seemed to mellow out as the series went on, and with enough time he might have reformed into a good guy. There was evidence of this in the Season 4 episode "No Man's An Island" when he skipped a chance to escape the island in order to go save the others, and stopped the troops from attacking Static, Gear, Rubberband Man and Talon by taking Alva hostage. He was also seemingly touched by Static's effort to risk his life to save Alva's son — to the point where he joined Static in the effort to save Edwin.

<p><b>Aquamaria/Maria</b> (voiced by Erika Velez in "Bad Stretch," <a href="/wiki/Yeni_%C3%81lvarez" title="Yeni Álvarez">Yeni Álvarez</a> in "Wet and Wild") is a <a href="/wiki/Girl" title="Girl">girl</a>, who was transformed into a transmorph, in her case a being of living <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a>, by the Big Bang. Unlike other Bang Babies with transmorphic abilities like Rubber-Band Man, Aquamaria could not change back and forth from her true human form for Lex (at least she was never seen to have such an ability in either of her appearances during the series' run). The only known background information given about Aquamaria is that she has a mother and a younger sister, who she lived with before she was exposed to Big Bang gas, not returning home after becoming a Bang Baby.
</p><p>As a life-form composed of <a href="/wiki/Colloid" title="Colloid">colloidal</a> water, the Bang-Baby known now as Aquamaria is capable of hydrokinetic abilities, able to manipulate her own form, expanding or compressing her physical mass and 'shapeshifting' parts of her body (like turning her hand and forearm into a net/bag to gather up cash when she and Hot-Streak robbed a music store in <i>Wet and Wild</i>.) In a fight, Aquamaria can aim a pressurized water attack from her arms similar to a <a href="/wiki/Geyser" title="Geyser">geyser</a>, or become one herself. Able to merge with a larger body of water, Aquamaria can overwhelm opponents by becoming a living flood.
</p><p>In her first appearance in <i>Bad Stretch</i> (in season 2), Aquamaria, having been <a href="/wiki/Recruitment" title="Recruitment">recruited</a> by Ebon into the Meta-Breed, was undergoing her <a href="/wiki/Initiation" title="Initiation">initiation</a> by first robbing a stadium with the intention to lure out Static, and then take him down one-on-one. Ebon had been counting on her victory as he had thought that "her water powers would stop him for sure." While Aquamaria had successfully shorted out <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a>'s powers, she was taken on and captured by the <a href="/wiki/Rubber-Band_Man_(Static_Shock)" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubber-Band Man (Static Shock)">Rubber-Band Man</a>. She was then taken into police custody and kept contained by a specialized containment unit that was custom-made just for her. Aquamaria was later broken out of jail, along with other members of the Meta-Breed, by <a href="/wiki/Ebon_(character)" class="mw-redirect" title="Ebon (character)">Ebon</a> disguised as Rubber-Band Man to frame him. When <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a> revealed Ebon's deception and the gang Ebon lead as the Meta-Breed while the Rubber-Band Man fought Ebon alone, he then had to take on Aquamaria, successfully neutralizing her by using his head and <a href="/wiki/Electrolysis" title="Electrolysis">electrolysis</a> to break her down from water into <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>—while she survived this, it left her unconscious.
</p><p>Aquamaria later teamed up with <a href="/wiki/Hot-Streak" class="mw-redirect" title="Hot-Streak">Hot-Streak</a>, but was frozen by <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gear_(Static_Shock)" class="mw-redirect" title="Gear (Static Shock)">Gear</a>. Later, a team of scientists offered her the chance to be the first to try their antidote for the Big Bang mutagen, and despite an attempt by <a href="/wiki/Hot-Streak" class="mw-redirect" title="Hot-Streak">Hot-Streak</a> to sabotage the treatment, Aquamaria was eventually returned to normal.

Boom was able to generate large and unusually strong amounts of hypersonic sound waves from a loudspeaker on his chest, causing massive amounts of damage. Mirage's powers are of illusion-casting. Boom and Mirage steal a lot of money; Boom claims it's for supporting his grandmother. While it is implied that Boom's aggressive personality may have been the result of his exposure to Big-Bang gas (as Mirage reveals to Static that her brother never acted like that before), Mirage keeps her own personality and becomes increasingly disturbed by Boom's actions (as Boom's Quantum Vapour-exposure may have just brought out a worse side of him he had just never shown before). Mirage finally helps Static trap her brother, and in return, creates an illusion of Static flying away (to mislead Sharon, who was starting to suspect that Virgil and Static were one and the same).

</p><p>Kangor's exposure and reaction to the Big Bang gas has super-developed his lower body, especially his feet; the <a href="/wiki/Bone" title="Bone">bone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muscle" title="Muscle">muscle</a> mass of Kangor's legs and feet is noticeably larger than his upper body, endowing him with incredible lower body strength and giving rise to his <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">nom-de-crime</a>. Kangor prefers to get around by jumping rather than by walking (probably because of his big feet getting in the way of each other due to their size). In battle, Kangor typically leaps or <a href="/wiki/Cartwheel_(gymnastics)" title="Cartwheel (gymnastics)">cartwheels</a> into action; his kicks are powerful enough to smash stone and concrete with one hit.
</p><p>Aside from being the first villain featured in the intro for season two—Kangor makes his first appearance in <i>The Big Leagues</i>. Kangor, along with Hot-Streak, Talon, and Shiv, under the leadership of The Joker formed a new team in Dakota. He is first seen when Ferret's gag is taken off and the members of The Joker's crew are revealed. Kangor uses his feet later on to break into the Dakota Bank in a heist along with the other Bang Babies in The Joker's crew. Kangor is arrested at the end of the episode, but comes back to make his second appearance in season 2 in "Static Shaq" as a part of The Rough Pack, only to get a taste of his own medicine by Shaq.
</p><p>Kangor was the first known Bang Baby to be seen cured by Dr. Todd's aerosol Bang Baby cure at the end of the series where he woke up in the hospital with his legs and feet back to human size.

He was cured by <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>’s antidote and eventually began to cause trouble again, but not before along with all the other Bang Babies, he was reverted to his human form, when the antidote was spread throughout the city. Ferret does not really fight because of his size and non-offensive power, but is forced to by Hyde in <i>Static Shaq</i> and was defeated and again taken into police custody. After that Ferret and Kangor both quit and joined The Meta-Breed; Ferret did not return until Season 4. Like most of the other Bang Babies, he was changed back to normal by Dr. Todd's antidote.

<p><b>Royce Axelrod</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Bumper_Robinson" title="Bumper Robinson">Bumper Robinson</a>) was a student at Dakota Union High School, but was in fact nothing more than a <a href="/wiki/Criminal" class="mw-redirect" title="Criminal">thug</a>; Royce is an <a href="/wiki/Aggression" title="Aggression">aggressive</a> juvenile delinquent and an impulsive <a href="/wiki/Thief" class="mw-redirect" title="Thief">thief</a> with a history of stealing prior to the events of the episode "Pop's Girlfriend." His 'best friend' (the term is used loosely) was Frankie, his shadow, lap-dog, doormat, flunky, and 'Yes-Man' for most of the episode. It was hinted in the episode that he may have had some prior association with <a href="#Francis_Stone/F-Stop/Hot-Streak">F-Stop</a>.
</p><p>In his first appearance in the episode, Royce and Frankie are racing to catch the subway; Royce pushes a news stall vendor down as he reaches the steps, followed by Frankie who then both proceed to jump over the ticket stalls to avoid paying and run to get on the train before the doors close. While still on the train, Royce sees a large man in a fancy suit, with a metal briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, who then sits down and unlocks the cuffs to tend to his wrist—Royce sees an opportunity to take the briefcase, (even though he has no clue what's inside) and times it so that the doors have closed after he and Frankie have made it off and the man is trapped inside. At school, when a preoccupied Virgil Hawkins bumps into Royce by accident, Royce was hostile towards him, ignoring Virgil's apology and would have started a fight, had the principal not been there in the hallway watching the whole thing. Richie Foley comments on what Royce's trouble-making tendencies would result in: "Royce Axelrod: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/most_likely_to_succeed" class="extiw" title="wikt:most likely to succeed">most</a> <a href="/wiki/Yearbook" title="Yearbook">likely</a> to be sent <a href="/wiki/Prison" title="Prison">Upstate</a>."
</p><p>In an alley, after school, Royce and Frankie having taken the metal briefcase, break into it with a screwdriver and discover three vials of a glowing purple liquid inside, along with some papers. While remaining hidden from a patrolling police car, they keep the briefcase with them, now hoping to turn the "purple stuff" into "<a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">green stuff</a>." Royce keeps the briefcase hidden in his locker because he can't keep it at home; according to him, "after that shoplifting thing, my mom's been on the lookout for stuff that don't belong to me." Royce then brings up the papers he found inside and tells Frankie they're going to stay behind after school so that Frankie can use the computers to look up the vial's codes "about the purple stuff."
</p><p>When their research reveals that the 'purple stuff' they stole is, in fact, "Big Bang Super-Juice,"  Royce decides to inhale some of the gas, only thinking about the super powers that the gas could give him, "like it did to F-Stop," but Frankie speaks out against it and their arguing causes a few drops to fall into a wastepaper basket, and before their actions went any further, the arrival of a teacher makes them leave the computer lab with the case hidden away. Their actions however, were not without consequences, as a spider and a cockroach are exposed to the Big Bang liquid that spilled into the bin, and grow to giant size.
</p><p>The next day, Royce appears at school, and to Frankie's surprise, Royce had grown noticeably bigger, taller, and stronger than before, able to tear a hardback school textbook in half like it was paper; to Frankie's dismay, he blows Frankie off as a "loser," now that the Big Bang liquid was starting to take effect. This is not enough for Royce; after the results of just smelling the gas, he plans to drink the liquid and see what will happen to him next. Royce never got to go through with it; during a class test, Royce spontaneously mutates into a hideous, misshapen humanoid Bang-Baby, with pale pink skin and a primitive <a href="/wiki/Mindset" title="Mindset">mentality</a>. The 'monster' that Royce had now become attacked anyone within reach. In the end, Static restrained Royce using the arms of a statue to confine him.
</p><p>What became of Royce after these events was never revealed before the end of the series, though it can be assumed he was most likely subjected to Dr. Todd's Bang Baby cure when he exposed Dakota City to it.

Frankie however, was against exposing himself to the gas, not wanting to become a freak.
</p><p>When Royce's initial reaction to the gas had him grow taller in size, he more-or-less blew Frankie off as a "loser" in favor of his new status. When Royce mutated into a misshapen humanoid in the middle of class, Frankie was confronted by <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Virgil Hawkins</a>, who then knew that Frankie knew where the stolen briefcase with the vials of Big Bang gas was hidden.

Unfortunately, after a while the powers would wear out, and Leech required the host to be “sucked” dry again. Every time he drains an unwilling host's powers, he gets a physical feature of them, like a hairdo (as was the case with Hotstreak and Static) or something related to the host's power (like Talon's wing feathers on her arms).
</p><p>While he had some of the most powerful Bang Babies in his clutches, including Ebon, Hotstreak, Talon, and Static, he had the chance to steal Gear's powers, but not knowing he had any, Leech dismisses his powers as "<i>the kind you could buy from a hardware store</i>". His plans were foiled by Static and Lil’ Romeo. Remembering what Static had said about his powers, Lil’ Romeo "shorted" out Leech after he absorbed Static's powers, frying him and leaving him unconscious.

<p>Once attending Dakota Union High School, <b>Madelyn Spaulding</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Kimberly_Brooks" title="Kimberly Brooks">Kimberly Brooks</a>) was a self-centered and controlling girl. During Season 2 in the episode "Attack of the Living Brain Puppets," no one wanted to vote for her for freshman class president, which was so stressful for her that it triggered her Bang-Baby powers. She used her newly discovered powers to <a href="/wiki/Brainwashing" title="Brainwashing">brainwash</a> the students, making them behave like <a href="/wiki/Zombie" title="Zombie">zombies</a> (or "brain puppets," as her victims were referred to in the episode). Virgil was able to evade her mind control because his powers enhanced his body's natural electrical field to block her power. Once she entered Richie's mind, she discovered Static's secret identity. After having Pops, Sharon, Richie and all of the other Dakota Union students turn against him, as a result of Madelyn's mind control, Static electrified her brain, erasing her memory of ever being a Bang Baby and of <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a>'s secret identity. At the end of this episode, Madelyn was hospitalized.
</p><p>Madelyn shows up again later during Season 4 in the episode "She-Back!" She was released from the hospital and eventually was forced to work in a comic book store. However, she wasn't allowed back in school. She was only able to remember a few moments from her encounter with <a href="/wiki/Static_(DC_Comics)" title="Static (DC Comics)">Static</a>. Her encounter with the superhero resulted in the loss of her original powers and the gaining of new powers, which enabled her to <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" class="mw-redirect" title="Telekinesis">telekinetically</a> move things. This was triggered from her anger caused by thinking Virgil and Richie were laughing at her.
</p><p>She freed Hotstreak, Ebon, and Talon from jail and took the role as leader of the team. Her lead was short however, as she fought with Ebon over leadership. Static shows up and once again, shocks Madelyn's mind into submission and defeats the Meta-Breed with the help of Gear and She-Bang. What happened to Madelyn in the aftermath is left unrevealed.

<p>Whenever <b>Thomas Kim</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/John_Cho" title="John Cho">John Cho</a>) gets angry or upset, he transforms into the “Tantrum”, a purple-skinned, muscular, and violent metahuman that will destroy and wreak havoc on those he was angry at. Similar to Marvel's <a href="/wiki/Hulk" title="Hulk">Hulk</a>, Tantrum is ironically violent, strong, unintelligent, and sturdy; he is Thomas' polar opposite, like Bruce Banner is to the Hulk. They also both have contempt for their alter ego as when Static kept saying Tantrum was Thomas, he replied, "No. Not Thomas. Thomas weak."
</p><p>Thomas first became Tantrum in a nearby restaurant, destroying the inside and hurling Static into a nearby elevator. The next day, after receiving a 99/100 on an essay from Mrs. Pettibone due to a typographical error, he attacked her in the school parking lot. Later Richie found Thomas' near-perfect essay in the parking lot, leading Virgil and him to suspect Thomas was Tantrum. They confront Thomas about this in his home. Feeling threatened, accused, and teased, Thomas got angry and sent them away, transforming into Tantrum just moments later. Back at the Hawkin's home, Richie and Virgil are watching some home movies, in particular one where baby Virgil is throwing a fit. His mother tells his sister "sometimes you've got to let them work through that crankiness." Minutes later Tantrum arrives, breaking down the front door in the process, angry at them for accusing and teasing him. Virgil manages to distract him so Richie can escape. Virgil (now Static) leads Tantrum away from the inner parts of the city and into an abandoned amusement park. Still enraged, Tantrum began throwing equipment and debris with Static dodging and blocking but not attacking. Static was eventually able to “tire” Tantrum out by letting his rampage run its course without making his anger worse by attacking; by doing this, Tantrum reverted to his human form. Thomas' father seemed to raise his son for academic perfection. This is implied to cause social problems for Thomas, including stress and anger. After Static verifies that Thomas and Tantrum are the same person, he tells this to Mr. and Mrs. Kim, so that Thomas can get help for his problems. Static got Tantrum to calm down near an amusement part as he tells the police that he "had a tantrum."
</p><p>It is unknown if Thomas was one of the Bang Babies that was exposed to the Bang Baby cure (and, if he was, reinfected again).

</p><p>Much later in "Trouble Squared", they are hired by Edwin Alva Sr. to help restore his petrified son, but Specs and Trapper have other ideas; to effect their revenge on Static, they use the technical facilities to construct special equipment and adopt super-villain personas: Specs becomes <b>Spectral</b> (armed with a head <a href="/wiki/Visor" title="Visor">visor</a> which can discharge energy blasts, different colors having different effects (similar to the powers of the DC comics character, <a href="/wiki/Halo_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities" title="Halo (comics)">Halo</a>, of the <a href="/wiki/Outsiders_(comics)" title="Outsiders (comics)">Outsiders</a>)) and Trapper becomes <b>Speedtrap</b> (armed with a pair of gauntlets which can fire blasts of speed-manipulation force (the left controls deceleration and the right causes acceleration), causing targets to speed-up or slow-down, unable to control themselves, especially if they are it by a blast from both gauntlets). After they capture Static, however, Alva fires them because he is no longer primarily interested in capturing his enemy, and because of their causing damage to some of the equipment that was to be used in Alva Jr.'s restoration in their attempt to recapture Static after Static broke free. So Specs and Trapper hit upon a new plan: destroy Edwin Alva's son. At the end, Static saves Alva's son. Specs and Trapper are arrested for kidnapping and the news report states that they are old enough to be tried as adults.
</p><p>Some time later in "Where the Rubber Meets the Road" Specs and Trapper have gone truly renegade.

They plan to hold the city for ransom.

In the end, Static and Gear defeat Specs and Trapper by disabling their gadgets, while Rubber-Band Man subdues Tarmack and disables the unstable fusion engine.

The two later retaliated by capturing Edwin Alva Jr. causing Edwin to obtain Static's help. After Edwin Alva Jr. was rescued and Specs and Trapper are arrested, Edwin Alva donated a large check to Robert Hawking's children center. The second attempt to restore Edwin Alva Jr. occurs in "No Man's an Island" when Edwin Alva orchestrates the captures of Static, Hot-Streak, Gear, Talon, and Rubberband Man in order for his scientists to siphon their energies for the restoration machine. When it came to the episode's climax, Static and Hot-Streak donated their energy to the machine which then restored Edwin Alva's son. His appearance resemble Michael Douglas's character Gordon Gecko from <i><a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film)" title="Wall Street (1987 film)">Wall Street</a></i>, and creator Dwayne McDuffie has said that the character was supposed to have been "more <a href="/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole" title="Peter O&#39;Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> than <a href="/wiki/Peter_Fonda" title="Peter Fonda">Peter Fonda</a>".</li></ul>
