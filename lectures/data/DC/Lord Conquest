In the Post-<i><a href="/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">Crisis</a></i> timeline, Ares had plotted to start World War III, which led to Diana becoming Wonder Woman. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_52" title="The New 52">The New 52</a></i>, Ares is mostly referred to as War and, in a major departure from the character's longstanding history as one of Wonder Woman's archenemies, is re-imagined as a benign supporting character.

One of Wonder Woman's most persistent foes, he plagued her throughout the Golden, Silver and Bronze Ages. Little is known about the true history of the Duke of Deception.

As an Atlantean, Queen Clea can breathe both above and under water. Clea can also physically withstand the great amounts of undersea depth pressures.

Being pragmatic, he bargained for Hera's permission to take the throne if he returned the last of Zeus' lovers to her. Apollo proved the wiser of the two, as Hera only permitted Apollo the chance in the belief that Zeus would immediately return to her, while Apollo had realized through portents that he would not; he did not even exist. He remained an adversary of Wonder Woman as his goals generally moved against hers, though he lacked the rage his sister felt for having been badly beaten by the Amazon. Apollo's planning came undone eventually when he believed he could torture the First Born into relinquishing his own quest for the throne, ending with his older brother breaking free and killing him.
