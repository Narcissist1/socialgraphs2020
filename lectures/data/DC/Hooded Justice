These characters were originally based on the <a href="/wiki/Mighty_Crusaders" title="Mighty Crusaders">Mighty Crusaders</a><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and then reworked in an unsolicited proposal to fit superhero properties DC had acquired from <a href="/wiki/Charlton_Comics" title="Charlton Comics">Charlton Comics</a> in the early 1980s. Moore later based the team’s predecessors, the Minutemen, off of the Mighty Crusaders. Since the publisher planned to integrate Charlton's superheroes into the main <a href="/wiki/DC_Universe" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a> and the script would have made many of them unusable for future stories, series writer Alan Moore eventually agreed to create original characters. Moore wished the main characters to present six "radically opposing ways" to perceive the world, and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally comprehensible.<sup id="cite_ref-strange_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-strange-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The protagonists of <i>Watchmen</i> were reused in the prequel series <i><a href="/wiki/Before_Watchmen" title="Before Watchmen">Before Watchmen</a></i>, which also gave backstories to several minor characters from the original graphic novel, and introduced new characters.
</p><p>Later on, several Watchmen characters reappeared in the limited series <i><a href="/wiki/Doomsday_Clock_(comics)" title="Doomsday Clock (comics)">Doomsday Clock</a></i>, bringing them into the main <a href="/wiki/DC_Universe" title="DC Universe">DC Universe</a>.
</p><p>The television series <i><a href="/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)" title="Watchmen (TV series)">Watchmen</a></i> is set in the same <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a> as the limited series, taking place in 2019 in <a href="/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma" title="Tulsa, Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>.

</p><p>Blake's murder, which takes place shortly before the story begins in 1985, sets the plot of <i>Watchmen</i> in motion.

<p><b>Dr. Jonathan</b> "<b>Jon</b>" <b>Osterman</b> is a vigilante and the only character with <a href="/wiki/Superpower_(ability)" title="Superpower (ability)">superpowers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Wright272_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wright272-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> He was originally a <a href="/wiki/Physicist" title="Physicist">physicist</a> who was transformed into a blue, irradiated powerful being after he was disintegrated in an Intrinsic Field Subtractor in 1959. He had returned to the chamber to retrieve his girlfriend's watch (which he had repaired), and was accidentally locked inside when the Subtractor started automatically. Osterman was blown into atoms, with nothing left of his body. Within a few months, his disembodied consciousness managed to reconstruct a physical body for itself, after several hideous partial reconstructions. Following his reanimation, he is immediately pressed into service by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_government" class="mw-redirect" title="United States government">United States government</a>, which gives him the name <b>Doctor Manhattan</b>, after the <a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>.

Since he works for the U.S. government, he is exempt from the provisions of the <a href="/wiki/Keene_Act" class="mw-redirect" title="Keene Act">Keene Act</a>, but spends much of his time doing advanced technology research and development, and physics research. He is single-handedly responsible for the shift to electric-powered vehicles (by synthesizing the needed elements and chemicals himself) and Veidt credits him with causing a huge leap forward in myriad areas of science and technology. As a result, the technology of the alternative 1985 of the <i>Watchmen</i> universe is far more advanced. After the death of his father in 1969, he does not conceal his birth name and is referred to as "Jon" or "Dr. Osterman".

For much of the series, he is solely known by the name <b>Cal Abar</b>, the husband of series protagonist Angela Abar and the survivor of an unnamed accident in 2009 which wiped all his memory. Instead, Manhattan had in fact installed a device into his forehead that suppressed his superpowers and his omniscient sense of time, allowing him to pursue a comfortable relationship with Angela, though this did remove his memory prior to 2009. Late in the series, in 2019, Angela discovers a plot by the white supremacist ring the Seventh Kavalry to destroy Manhattan and harness his powers; Angela subsequently forcibly removed the device from his forehead, causing him to regain his abilities and appearance, though immediately afterward he is captured by the Kavalry. As Senator Joe Keene Jr., the Kavalry's leader, prepares to destroy Manhattan while harnessing his powers (ultimately killing Keene in the process since the machine didn't have a component that can filter the atomic energy), Lady Trieu intervenes, kills the rest of the Kavalry, and continues the demonstration in attempt to take his powers for herself so that she can do improvements to the world which Doctor Manhattan never got around to doing. Trieu is successful in killing Manhattan and he shares a final moment with Angela before he dies, though Trieu's plans are ultimately upended by Veidt and she is killed by another of his attacks. At the end of the series, Manhattan is revealed to have maybe transferred his powers to Angela.

<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ozymandias_(Watchmen)" title="Ozymandias (Watchmen)">Ozymandias (Watchmen)</a></div>
<p><b>Ozymandias</b> (<b>Adrian Alexander Veidt</b>) was a former superhero who draws inspiration from his hero <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and the Egyptian pharaoh <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" title="Ramesses II">Ramesses II</a>, for whom he is named. A child prodigy, he graduated from high school and college before he was 18 and learned the art of lying as he hid the full scope of his brilliance for most of his childhood after being accused of cheating. When he inherited his family's fortune upon his parents' death in a car accident, Adrian gave it away to see if he could be a success by himself. Veidt traced Alexander the Great's path across the globe and ultimately returned to the United States, where he became a successful businessman. However, when his business partner and would-be love interest overdosed on drugs (purchased with funds given to her by Adrian as a gift to allow her to have fun in New York City one night), Veidt decided to avenge her death as a superhero. His costume was conceived as a Halloween costume but he quickly developed a name for himself as a hero.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Two years before the Keene Act passed, Veidt went public with his secret identity and began merchandising his alter ego as he became one of the most important businessmen in the USA. However, his fear of a nuclear war between the USSR and the US, plus a rivalry with the Comedian (who unknowingly planted the idea of stopping the inevitable <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust" title="Nuclear holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> into Veidt's head), led to him engaging in the vast conspiracy at the heart of the <i>Watchmen</i> series.
</p><p>Ozymandias was directly based on <a href="/wiki/Peter_Cannon,_Thunderbolt" title="Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt">Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt</a>, whom Moore had admired for using his full brain capacity as well as possessing full physical and mental control.<sup id="cite_ref-cba_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cba-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Veidt is believed to be the smartest man on the planet, even capable of outsmarting Dr Manhattan. His combination of intelligence and highly advanced fighting skills makes him perhaps the most feared and dangerous of the mortal vigilantes. He was even able to <a href="/wiki/Bullet_catch" title="Bullet catch">catch a bullet</a> fired at him (Chapter XII, page 15). He is often accompanied by his genetically engineered <a href="/wiki/Lynx" title="Lynx">lynx</a>, Bubastis. Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to "help the world", Veidt displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories, and in a sense he is the "villain" of the series; however, he purposely acts for an objective greater good, thus avoiding the traditional "villain" classification, which is typically self-serving, delusional or evil.<sup id="cite_ref-Reynolds_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Reynolds-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Gibbons noted "One of the worst of his sins [is] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity, scorning the rest of humanity."<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> In 2008, he was ranked number 10 on the <a href="/wiki/Forbes_Fictional_15" title="Forbes Fictional 15">Forbes Fictional 15</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/Wizard_(magazine)" title="Wizard (magazine)">Wizard</a></i> magazine also ranked Ozymandias as 25th-greatest villain of all time and <a href="/wiki/IGN" title="IGN">IGN</a> ranked him as 21st-greatest comic book villain of all time.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In the <i>Watchmen</i> film, Veidt is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Goode" title="Matthew Goode">Matthew Goode</a>. His costume was designed to parody the rubber suits featuring nipples in the film <i><a href="/wiki/Batman_%26_Robin_(film)" title="Batman &amp; Robin (film)">Batman &amp; Robin</a></i>. This incarnation of Veidt uses a German accent when speaking with friends and an American accent when speaking publicly. Instead of breeding a giant monster and placing it in New York to massacre half the city as in the comics, Veidt destroys New York, along with many major cities across the globe, with energy blasts designed to look as though Doctor Manhattan had caused it, bringing world peace.
</p><p>In the television series, Veidt is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Irons" title="Jeremy Irons">Jeremy Irons</a>. In the years since 1985, he continued to run his companies and helped to advance technology beyond those of Doctor Manhattan, which the world feared due to its ties with cancer. However, Veidt became recluse, and sometime before 2019, Veidt is reported to have died with his company acquired by Lady Trieu, revealed to be his daughter through artificial insemination. However, Veidt instead had spent much of the time since 1985 in Karnak, using the same teleportation device used for the squid to send storms of smaller squids randomly across the earth as to hold up the pretense of an alien invasion and ward off further international conflict. To his dismay, the world did not become the utopia he hoped to oversee, and in 2009, he took Doctor Manhattan's offer to be transported to a closed ecosystem Manhattan had created on <a href="/wiki/Europa_(moon)" title="Europa (moon)">Europa</a> to be adored by clones of two servants, Phillips and Crookshanks. Initially pleasing, Veidt soon became bored and instructed the first Phillips to become an adversary to him, the Game Warden. The Seventh Kavalry had somehow obtained pre-recorded footage that Veidt made in the event that <a href="/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a> became President of the United States. Over the next eight years, Veidt was able to briefly escape the ecosystem to leave a message to Lady Trieu for rescue, which comes in the form of an automated craft. For the trip back to Earth, Trieu turned him into a gold statue, having him revert to his human state years later so that he could witness her destruction of Manhattan and attempted harnessing of his powers. Transported back to his lair in Antarctica by Manhattan, Veidt uses his squid teleportation device to attack Tulsa so that he can stop Trieu from becoming a god. He is successful, only to be arrested by Wade Tillman and Laurie Blake for his many crimes. Prior to being knocked out by Wade, Veidt asked if the FBI was going to go after Robert Redford as well which he got a positive answer out of it.

He was born <b>Walter Joseph Kovacs</b>, the son of an abusive prostitute by a man whose last name his mother never bothered to learn, and spent much of his childhood in a home for troubled youth, after which he began working in a garment factory. After reading about the <a href="/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese" title="Murder of Kitty Genovese">murder of Kitty Genovese</a> and the reported complete indifference of the witnesses of the crime, he modified a special fabric that she had ordered, according to him, to create a mask and became a vigilante, eventually forming a productive partnership with Nite Owl II.

</p><p>When the story begins, a man is seen walking around New York carrying a sign that reads, "The End Is Nigh", but it is not until several chapters later that the reader learns that this man is Kovacs/Rorschach.

<p><b>Laurel Jane</b> "<b>Laurie</b>" <b>Juspeczyk</b> (<b>Silk Spectre</b>) is the daughter of Sally Jupiter, the first Silk Spectre. Laurie's mother apparently wanted her to follow in her footsteps and so she fought crime for ten years before the Keene Act banned vigilantes. Unlike the other protagonists, Silk Spectre was not based on a particular Charlton character, although her relationship with Dr. Manhattan is similar to that between Captain Atom and the heroine <a href="/wiki/Nightshade_(DC_Comics)" title="Nightshade (DC Comics)">Nightshade</a>. Moore felt he needed a female hero in the cast and drew inspiration from comic book heroines such as <a href="/wiki/Black_Canary" title="Black Canary">Black Canary</a> and <a href="/wiki/Phantom_Lady" title="Phantom Lady">Phantom Lady</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-cba_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cba-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Laurie is kept on retainer by the government because of her relationship with Doctor Manhattan and lives on a government base at the beginning of the comic. When Doctor Manhattan leaves Earth, the government has her removed from the base and suspends her expense account, forcing her to move in with Dan, with whom she starts a romantic relationship. At the end of the eighth issue, Doctor Manhattan appears and takes her to <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a> because he knows she wants to convince him to save the world. On Mars, she realizes that the Comedian was her biological father. After the final encounter with Veidt at the end of the series, she assumes the identity of Sandra Hollis and continues her relationship with Dan. An offhand comment to Dan, in which she claims to want a better costume, with leather and a sidearm, implies she's thinking about taking over her late father's identity, thus becoming the second Comedian.
</p><p>In the <i>Watchmen</i> film, she is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Malin_%C3%85kerman" title="Malin Åkerman">Malin Åkerman</a>. In a 2003 draft script by <a href="/wiki/David_Hayter" title="David Hayter">David Hayter</a>, which was reviewed by <i><a href="/wiki/IGN" title="IGN">IGN</a></i>, Laurie uses the name Jupiter, and the alter ego name "Slingshot".<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> The former detail seems to have been retained in the final version of the film (though the Nite Owl's goggles gave her last name as her mother's maiden name, Juspeczyk). The film gives her date of birth as December 2, 1949. Silk Spectre was ranked 24th in <i><a href="/wiki/Comics_Buyer%27s_Guide" title="Comics Buyer&#39;s Guide">Comics Buyer's Guide</a></i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;s</span> "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In the television series, Laurie (portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jean_Smart" title="Jean Smart">Jean Smart</a>) has given up vigilantism and joined the FBI, becoming an agent in the Anti-Vigilante Task Force. On one mission, she and her co-workers posed as bank robbers at National Bank Inc. to draw out Mister Shadow. Though hinted to think of Dan where she owns a pet owl, it's heavily hinted she pines for Doctor Manhattan. She is sent by Senator Joe Keene Jr. to Tulsa, whom apparently offers to have Dan released from prison. Laurie is sent to investigate the death of Judd Crawford, but in reality to help the Seventh Kavalry locate Doctor Manhattan. She is present for Veidt manufacturing another squid attack in an attempt to stop Lady Trieu from becoming a godlike entity, and ultimately arrests Veidt for his many crimes. While she does not have a crime-fighting alter ego anymore, this older, hardened version of Laurie nevertheless shows several parallels with her father the Comedian, with her having taken her father's last name, sharing his affinity for jokes as metaphors for her worldview, and having become an FBI agent after giving up vigilantism as the Comedian did before her.

<p><b>Dollar Bill</b> (real name <b>William Benjamin "Bill" Brady</b>) is a bank-sponsored member of the Minutemen who was created by National Bank Inc. for publicity purposes. While he is described as having no actual superpowers, Dollar Bill was known for having apparently supernatural luck, surviving many things that should have outright killed him. Socially conservative, he is portrayed in <i>Before Watchmen</i> as <a href="/wiki/Homophobic" class="mw-redirect" title="Homophobic">homophobic</a> (barely tolerating his homosexual Minutemen colleagues) and good friends with the ultra-right-wing Comedian, voting to let him stay after the attempted rape of Sally Jupiter. He dies during a bank robbery at National Bank Inc. in 1947 when his cape is caught in the bank's revolving doors, allowing the robbers to shoot him at point-blank range. This was a problem he warned his employers at National Bank Inc. about, but they insisted the cape had to be part of the costume as Mason laments in his book. Even Rorschach, who dislikes Ozymandias for making his superhero alter-ego into a toy line, laments Dollar Bill's death while Hollis Mason commented in his book that his death would've been averted if Dollar Bill designed his own costume.

<p><b>Hollis Mason</b> is the first <b>Nite Owl</b> who retired in 1962, and author of the autobiography "Under The Hood" which appears in excerpts throughout the story. Hollis was the only member of the Minutemen who did not have any social problems and mainly enjoyed being a costumed adventurer. On Halloween 1985, The Knot-Tops led by Derf assault Hollis in retaliation for the release of Rorschach, which was caused by Nite Owl II (Daniel Dreiberg) and Silk Spectre II (Laurie Juspeczyk). Derf hits Hollis on the head with Mason's own Nite Owl trophy killing the former superhero (in the film, this event is only depicted in the director's cut version). Hollis' death was avenged when Derf is among those killed by Ozymandias' giant monster.
</p><p><i>Before Watchmen: Night Owl #1</i> showed that Dan Dreiberg's obsession with the original Nite Owl led him to plant a remote microphone device on Hollis' vehicle in order to track him down.<sup id="cite_ref-Before_Watchmen:_Nite_Owl_#1_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Before_Watchmen:_Nite_Owl_#1-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> At the funeral of Dreiberg's father, Hollis discovered Dan's abusive childhood via police reports.

<p><b>Hooded Justice</b> is the first masked vigilante, often initialled <b>"H. J."</b> by his teammates. His real identity is never conclusively revealed but in Hollis Mason's book it is suggested to be circus <a href="/wiki/Strongman_(strength_athlete)" title="Strongman (strength athlete)">strongman</a> <b>Rolf Müller</b>.
</p><p>This is <a href="/wiki/Retconned" class="mw-redirect" title="Retconned">retconned</a> heavily in <i>Before Watchmen: Minutemen</i> #6, where we learn that he is not Rolf Muller (a character that sexually abused and killed children), but it is strongly implied that he is Muller's son or ward, <b>Jacob</b>. Assuming that he himself was a victim of Muller's abuse, it explains a great deal about his violent persona, costume, and mask. A violent vigilante, Hooded Justice shared a romantic homosexual relationship with Captain Metropolis and a deep-seated rivalry with Comedian, after he prevented Blake from sexually assaulting Silk Spectre. Hooded Justice's relationship with Metropolis was a fractured one; Justice repeatedly cheated on his boyfriend with male prostitutes, physically abusing them in <a href="/wiki/Sadomasochist" class="mw-redirect" title="Sadomasochist">sadomasochist</a> sexual encounters. This resulted in bribery of his lovers and the usage of Silk Spectre as his <a href="/wiki/Beard_(companion)" title="Beard (companion)">public girlfriend</a>. He ultimately disappeared in the 1950s after refusing to cooperate with <a href="/wiki/HUAC" class="mw-redirect" title="HUAC">HUAC</a>'s new policy on costumed vigilantes. In the original novel it is suggested that he was murdered either by the Comedian for voting him out of the Minutemen (as Ozymandias believes), or by the <a href="/wiki/Stasi" title="Stasi">Stasi</a> of his native <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a>. In the retcon we learn that Hollis Mason, mistakenly believing him to be Muller, attacked Hooded Justice and snapped his neck, killing him. He was never actually unmasked, and Metropolis burned down the headquarters with his former lover's body inside; it later turns out that the Comedian was the one who misdirected Mason to believe that Justice was Muller, so Ozymandias was partially right. Much of the "Under the Hood" information on Muller and HJ is revealed to be a deliberate lie on Mason's part. This may be contrary to the intent of the original novel. In chapter 1, the fourth panel of page 25 focuses on two old men sitting affectionately together near Dan and Laurie in Rafael's restaurant. They look very much like older versions of Rolf Muller and Nelson Gardner, and it was speculated by many fans that these were in fact Hooded Justice and Captain Metropolis, who had faked their deaths in order to retire and be together. Dave Gibbons said this was unintended but allowed that it might be true. In the retconned world of <i>Before Watchmen</i>, it is obviously not the case.
</p><p>In the film, Hooded Justice was portrayed by Glenn Ennis who speaks the character's one line with a subtle German accent.
</p><p>In the TV series, Hooded Justice is revealed to have been <b>Will Reeves</b>, a black man who had escaped from the 1921 <a href="/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot" class="mw-redirect" title="Tulsa race riot">Tulsa race riot</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Gossett_Jr." title="Louis Gossett Jr.">Louis Gossett Jr.</a> as an old man and <a href="/wiki/Jovan_Adepo" title="Jovan Adepo">Jovan Adepo</a> as a young man). He became one of the first black officers in the New York City police force. After stumbling into a plot by the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> called "Cyclops" which sought to incite violence between black people, Reeves was nearly lynched by white officers as a warning to stay out of their business. While still wearing the noose and hood, Reeves helped a young couple fend off thugs that were trying to rob him, and his deed named him a hero the next day. Reeves took up the name Hooded Justice, using the costume to mask his race. He was invited into the Minutemen by Captain Metropolis, but cautioned from revealing his race to the other members. When Reeves found further clues to "Cyclops" including the use of hypnotic strobe effects to coerce black people into violence, the Minutemen refused to help, and Reeves took it on himself to end the New York City operation. This led to Reeves becoming disillusioned to his role, staying behind when his wife and son returned to Tulsa. In 2019, Reeves reveals himself to Angela, his granddaughter, and uses a modified version of the Cyclops hypnosis effect to chase down those with association with Cyclops. When Angela restores Doctor Manhattan's memories, he sends their adopted children to Reeves where they were when Veidt caused frozen squids to rain down on Lady Trieu and her followers. Angela found that he and her adopted children took refuge in a theater where Reeves stated that he saw the movie that inspired him to become Hooded Justice.

<p><b>Mothman</b> (real name <b>Byron Alfred Lewis</b>) is a former member of the Minutemen who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness later in life. Lewis had a privileged upbringing and sought to help the less fortunate and fight oppression and corruption as a crimefighter. To this end, Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him glide, dubbing himself "Mothman".

<p><b>Twilight Lady</b> (real name <b>Elizabeth "Liz" Lane</b>) is a <a href="/wiki/Dominatrix" title="Dominatrix">dominatrix</a>-styled villain of Nite Owl II, seen only in an autographed photograph and erotic dream sequence in the original novel.

In the game, Nite Owl II and Rorschach must fight her and the Comedian, the latter of whom is ultimately sent to kill the Sin Queen to stop her extortion racket.
</p><p>However, <i>Before Watchmen: Nite Owl</i> portrays her as a dominatrix who befriends Nite Owl II when a fight between Dan and a crook spills over into her place of work. Falling for the hero and inspired by his heroic actions, she adopts the "Sin Queen" alias and becomes a super-hero, investigating a series of prostitute murders along with Nite Owl and a jealous Rorschach. The murderer of the prostitutes turns out to be a fire and brimstone minister whom Rorschach is friends with; Nite Owl rescues the Sin Queen, whom the minister kidnaps and threatens to burn alive. The near death experience causes her to give up her would-be career as a hero. Dan lied to Laurie about her being a former lover of his, and passed her off as a criminal who was fixated on him to hide their relationship.

<p>The <b>Alien Monster</b> (referred to by fans as the <b>Squid</b>) is a 100-foot, <a href="/wiki/Giant_squid" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a>-like monster with one eye, dozens of long muscular tentacles, and an exposed brain. It was created by Ozymandias as part of his plan to save the world from a nuclear holocaust. Adrian Veidt had transported science fiction writers Max Shea and James Trafford March, surreal artist Hira Manish, and an assortment of other writers, artists, and scientists to his private island under the impression that they are being used for a top secret movie production. It took several months to genetically engineer the monster where its brain was actually the cloned brain of the deceased psychic Robert Deschaines which was augmented by a psychic resonant device. Once it was complete, Veidt had the ship that was taking them home blown up to erase his involvement in what will happen next. At midnight on November 2, 1985, Veidt teleported the Alien Monster into the heart of New York City, where its tentacles and large sections of its body exploded upon impact. In addition, the Alien Monster's brain unleashed a massive psychic shockwave that caused thousands more deaths. Its dead body was discovered by Doctor Manhattan and Silk Spectre.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Doomsday_Clock_(comics)" title="Doomsday Clock (comics)">Doomsday Clock</a></i> #3, the Alien Monster was seen in <a href="/wiki/Rorschach_(Reggie_Long)" title="Rorschach (Reggie Long)">Reggie Long</a>'s nightmare.
</p><p>In the film, the Alien Monster was replaced with exploding energy reactors that generate a radioactive decay signature similar to Doctor Manhattan as a way to frame him for the retaliated attack in light of the cancer allegations against him.
</p><p>In the TV series, it is shown that "squidfalls", unexplained meteorological occurrences in which thousands of smaller alien monsters fall from the sky, occur around the world as late as 2019. These are revealed to be the continuing work of Adrian Veidt, believing them necessary to maintain fear of the "aliens" and thereby world peace. Episode 5 shows the effect of the psychic shockwave in Looking Glass' flashback where its body was shown and a younger Looking Glass is among the survivors of the attack. It also shows Veidt recording a message for future President Robert Redford in front of the Squid moments before its teleportation. In the season one finale, Veidt engineers a frozen squidfall over the city of Tulsa, killing Lady Trieu and thousands of others in the surrounding area before she is able to absorb Doctor Manhattan's powers. In the same episode, Wade was able to obtain the recording of Veidt's message to Redford to be used as evidence.

<p><b>Sister Night</b> (portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Regina_King" title="Regina King">Regina King</a> as an adult, Faithe Herman as a child) is the masked identity of Angela Abar. Angela was born in Vietnam (by that point, the 51st state). Her parents were killed by a suicide bomber and her grandmother June came to bring her to the continental United States only to suffer a heart attack.
</p><p>In 2009, she met Doctor Manhattan in Vietnam where he asked her on a date and informed her they would fall in love. Due to her hatred of Manhattan and skepticism of his identity, she initially refuses to believe him but nonetheless goes on the date with him to humor him; they quickly fall in love and he assumes the physical form of the deceased Calvin Jelani so that they can be together in public. When Angela grows frustrated with Manhattan's omniscient view of time, they agree to install a device into his forehead that suppresses his supernatural abilities, though this also temporarily removes his memories. Following the implementation of the device, Angela tells Manhattan that his name is Cal Abar and that he has suffered amnesia following an accident. Together, they move to Tulsa where Angela joins the <a href="/wiki/Tulsa_Police_Department" title="Tulsa Police Department">Tulsa Police Department</a>.
</p><p>On Christmas Eve 2015, Angela and Cal were attacked by members of the Seventh Kavalry, a white supremacist group who were upset at the police's enforcement of special reparations for victims of racial injustice stemming from the <a href="/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot" class="mw-redirect" title="Tulsa race riot">Tulsa race riot</a> in 1921. Angela survived the attack, but learned from her superior Chief Judd Crawford that the homes of 39 other officers were attacked, and of those that survived, only Angela and Judd were staying on the force.
</p><p>To protect officers, a law was passed to require officers to disavow their profession and disguise themselves. Angela opted to take up the Sister Night costume, itself inspired by the fictional <a href="/wiki/Blaxploitation" title="Blaxploitation">blaxploitation</a> 70s film <i>Sister Night: The Nun With The Motherf%&amp;$ing Gun</i>. Her outfit consists of black spraypaint going across her eye areas, a black <a href="/wiki/Nun" title="Nun">nun</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Religious_habit" title="Religious habit">habit</a>, a black <a href="/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)" title="Balaclava (clothing)">balaclava</a> going over her nose and mouth, a white shirt, black trousers, and long black boots with heels. In her day-to-day life, Angela is a <a href="/wiki/Baker" title="Baker">baker</a> who runs a bakery called "Milk and Hanoi" where the sign on it still says "Opening Soon." She and Cal also adopted three children whose parents were killed during White Night.
</p><p>Angela investigates Judd Crawford's death in 2019, quickly deducing that he was a KKK member as well as a founding member of the Seventh Kavalry, though initially covering up this information as she investigates the identity of Crawford's killer, Will Reeves, who claims to be her grandfather. When she is incarcerated for covering up the details of Crawford's death, Angela impulsively swallows an entire bottle of Nostalgia, pills that contain Reeves's memory, and she learns that he was the Hooded Justice, the first-ever masked vigilante.
</p><p>Angela later learns of the Seventh Kavalry's plans to destroy Doctor Manhattan and forcibly removes the device from Cal's forehead, causing him to regain his memories, his omniscience, and his normal appearance. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Kavalry and, despite both Angela's and Manhattan's attempts to stop them, he is captured. Keene prepares to harness Manhattan's powers, but it is thwarted by Trieu and Keene is reduced to ooze because the machine he used didn't have a component to filter the atomic energy. Angela watches as Trieu kills the entire Kavalry and plans to claim Manhattan's powers for herself. Accepting the inevitable, Manhattan transports Blake, Tillman, and Veidt away from the Kavalry's base but keeps Angela by his side so that they can be together when he dies; he assumes Cal's appearance for a final time and tells Angela that he loves her as he is finally destroyed by Trieu.
</p><p>When Veidt manufactures another squid attack to upend Trieu's plans to harness Manhattan's powers, killing her in the process, Angela finds safety in a local theater, where Will Reeves has taken her kids. She shares a moment of clarity with Will and she finally accepts him as her grandfather, allowing him to stay with them as they take her children home. Her oldest son Topher learns at this time that she is Sister Night. When she arrives home, Angela realizes that Manhattan may have transferred his powers into an egg, something he indicated was possible on the first night they met. Angela eats the raw egg. She then starts to see if she can walk across water as the episode abruptly ends. It is implied that she obtains Manhattan's powers as a result.

<p><b>Judd Crawford</b> (portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Don_Johnson" title="Don Johnson">Don Johnson</a>) was the <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_police" title="Chief of police">chief</a> of the Tulsa Police Department. During his tenure, Judd was also the leader of a separate <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">KKK</a>-eqsue cell of the secret white supremacist, domestic terrorist organization Cyclops. Judd conspired with Senator Joe Keene Jr. to orchestrate the "White Night", an event that resulted in Tulsa police officers and their families being killed in their homes where the ones that were sleeping in bed took the brunt of the attacks. Judd had to make it look like that he was attacked. After the incident, Keene Jr. passed a new law which forced officers to wear masks, partly to protect the identities of officers and appear "tough on crime", while secretly fomenting public mistrust of the police. Following one of the fights with the Seventh Kavalry, Judd was hypnotized by Will Reeves to hang himself.
</p><p>Judd's death allowed Senator Keene to invite Laurie Blake to Tulsa to investigate, secretly luring her there for his own purposes. While Sister Night discovered Judd's connection with the KKK, Looking Glass learned from Keene Jr. that Judd led the police department on Joe's behalf while Joe led the Seventh Kavalry. It is revealed in the final episode that after the White Night event, Judd and his wife discerned that Cal was actually Doctor Manhattan and purposely got close to the Abar family so he could help the Kavalry in their plot to destroy Manhattan.

A female member of the Knot Top Gang lured him into a hall of mirrors with the promise of sex, but instead ran off with his clothes except for his shoes and socks. Before he could give chase, psychic waves from the appearance of the alien monster in New York City shook the area, and Wade found himself one of the few survivors. This left Wade with a <a href="/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, leaving him fearful of squids, building a bunker in his backyard, and pushing him towards isolation.

As Looking Glass, he uses his "Pod", a small chamber with various screens on its walls, to interrogate subjects: he flashes various images on the screens to judge their responses.
</p><p>In "Little Fear of Lightning", Wade is captured by the Seventh Kavalry and is shown the video in which Veidt confesses to having manufactured the alien squid attack. Senator Keene shows Wade the video on the condition that Wade bring Angela to the Kavalry in return. Disillusioned by what he has seen, Wade has Angela turned in for her having covered up the details of Judd's death. Despite his compliance, he is that night attacked in his home by Kavalry members. After killing all the attackers, Looking Glass disappears.
</p><p>It is revealed several episodes later that he has infiltrated the Kavalry. Present for the attempted destruction of Manhattan by the Kavalry and by Trieu, Wade is transported by Manhattan to Veidt's office in Antarctica alongside both Veidt and Blake, and aids Veidt in manufacturing a frozen squid attack to stop Trieu from absorbing Manhattan's powers. Subsequently, Wade and Blake both arrest Veidt for his many crimes. Wade knocked out Veidt after he got a positive answer on if the FBI was going to go after Robert Redford.

Trieu is highly intelligent due to Veidt's genetics, and calls herself the "smartest woman on Earth."
</p><p>Trieu came up with a means to capture Doctor Manhattan's powers in a quantum centrifuge, but was rebuffed by Veidt when she approached him for financial help in 2008. Instead, she established Trieu Enterprises, not only making it a trillion-dollar company, but using it as a front to construct her quantum centrifuge in Tulsa as the "Millennium Clock." During this time, she had expected to find Manhattan on Europa, but discovered a message from Veidt there and send an automated craft to recover him and bring him to earth by 2019 when her plan was to be completed. Lady Trieu has also created a clone of her mother Bian to assist her. Through Will Reeves, Lady Trieu learned of Manhattan's identity on earth as Cal Abar, husband to Angela. She also learned the Seventh Kavalry had discovered this as well and planned to capture Manhattan themselves and Will asks for her help to wipe the Kavalry and Cyclops out. 
</p><p>As Trieu's quantum centrifuge activates following the Kavalry's capture of Manhattan, Trieu teleports the Kavalry, Manhattan, Angela, Laurie, and Wade to downtown Tulsa with Bian and Veidt in attendance. When the ooze that what used to be Joe Keene Jr. emerged from the machine, Lady Trieu states that they didn't add a component to the machine to filter the atomic energies which can have that effect on anyone. She obliterates the Kavalry alongside the Cyclops leadership and triggers the centrifuge, but not before Manhattan teleports Veidt, Laurie, and Wade to Karnak, where they use Veidt's squid-rain-making device to send frozen squid projectiles in the immediate area. Though Trieu is able to destroy Manhattan before this, the squids destroy the centrifuge and kill Trieu before the transfer of power can be complete.
